# Brian's Market

Goal:

From an ordinary mum to a fantastic magician in Brian's eyes.

Story:
Brian wants his the very first Market App so he can define the area(eg his school),rent type(eg marbles),favorite flatmate(Elise?) etc. He chooses PacmanLoader as his favorite loading spinner. Joan is working hard to make his dream come true. This will be his 6-year-old birthday present in Dec. 2018.
